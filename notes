the HTMLElement builds it's scope out of the parameters passed down
    it then asks the store if the data is reactive and registers a listener for it


change the reactive model
    need to add the option to listen deep for changes in the store

    the objects return a watch method that receives an array of props to watch or true (void = this works for numbers strings, [...props] no props = all props, true = deep)
    
    can add dynamic weak ref store modules that will get removed along with the elements referencing them
    or static modules 
        
    when trying to listen for a value that has not yet been added just construct the reactive model up to that point
